This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust related to mutable borrows.  The `bug.rs` file shows the code that produces the error, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version.  Understanding borrowing rules is crucial for writing safe and efficient Rust code.  This example showcases the compiler's role in preventing data races and ensuring memory safety.
